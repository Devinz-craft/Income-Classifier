#üìä Income Classifier
## üìå Project Overview

This project explores and builds a machine learning model to classify individuals‚Äô income levels based on demographic and employment-related features. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training/evaluation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

### 1 Data Loading

- Importing the dataset (income_data.csv)

- Checking basic info, structure, and missing values

### 2 Data Preprocessing

- Standardizing column names

- Handling missing values

- Feature selection and transformation

### 3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizing distributions with matplotlib and seaborn

- Identifying correlations between income and features such as education, occupation, age, etc.

### 4 Model Building

- Splitting data into training and testing sets

- Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

- Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results & Insights

- Key patterns affecting income (e.g., education level, occupation, capital gains)

- Model performance comparison
